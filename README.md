#  Enhanced Search Engine for Research Article 

**Enhanced Search Engine for Research Article** is an **AI-driven semantic search and recommendation platform** designed for academic research discovery.  

It analyzes **abstracts or keywords** using **TF-IDF** or **Sentence Embedding** models to find the most relevant papers.  

Once a user subscribes via email, the system automatically delivers new articles with high semantic similarity, as well as papers citing or cited by the user’s preferred articles.  

Over time, the engine learns user preferences based on reading and engagement behavior, refining future recommendations for a personalized research experience.
